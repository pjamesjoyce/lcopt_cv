lcopt-cv: Create fully functional LCA models from hand drawn pictures of process diagrams
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lcopt-cv is a python module for creating LCA foreground models from hand drawn pictures of process flow diagrams developed by `James Joyce <https://pjamesjoyce.github.io/>`_.

Pretty much every LCA starts with drawing a process flow diagram. The difficult bit is turning that diagram into an LCA model which can be analysed.

What if you could just take a picture of the diagram you've just drawn and have it instantly turned into an LCA model?

Well now you can - introducing lcopt-cv, computer vision for LCA.

Features
--------

- Uses computer vision to generate an LCA model from a photograph of a process flow diagram
- Exports model directly to `lcopt <http://lcopt.rtfd.io>`_, allowing models to be analysed using `Brightway <http://www.brightwaylca.org>`_
- Links directly to the `ecoinvent <http://www.ecoinvent.org>`_ or `FORWAST <http://forwast.brgm.fr/>`_ databases
